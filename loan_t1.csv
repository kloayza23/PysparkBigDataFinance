To pay off an old loan with an unfavourably high APR of 24.99%. The payoff amount for this loan is $4,039 (as of 12/22/11, the date this loan would potentially fund).<br><br>2. For home repairs. My condo received some water damage during Hurricane Irene, which was worsened by rain storms during the following months. The entire building was affected and the condo board is co-ordinating repairs to finish in Spring 2012, but in order to cover the costs of this, each unit owner is requested to pay a special assessment in January 2012. My share of this is $4,164.<br><br>3. The remainder of the loan is to finance home improvements which I plan to coincide with the repairs in order to take advantage of the contractors already being there, and save some money. I plan to add a room and upgrade my rusting old boiler for an on-demand one to be more energy efficient. Quotes I've received for this range from $4,000-$5,000, so the total loan amount leaves a little buffer in case of unforeseen extra costs during the work, which is usually the case when dealing with contractors!<br><br>I am an executive with a very stable job for a company that is well-insulated from the economic problems. It is also worth noting that I share my condo, so mortgage and bills are split, giving me a comfortable buffer in my disposable income to cover payments on this loan without any adverse affects.<br><br>Thank you in advance for your consideration!<br>",major_purchase,Loan Payoff and Home Improvement,112xx,NY,2.21,0,May-2006,2,,,9,0,2217,18.8,13,f,0,0,15808.02,15808.02,14050,1758.02,0,0,0,Dec-2013,5569.67,,Dec-2013,0,,1,INDIVIDUAL,,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While the numbers crunch out to a D2 loan, let me take you beyond the numbers and show you how this is not your typical D2 loan.  The funds from this loan will be used strictly to pay down debts which carry significantly higher interest rates.  I experienced some life events in the past that caused the current situation.  I have worked hard to improve credit score and pay down the debts but with the interest rates so high its a real struggle.  I have been employed for 15 years with the same company (Fortune 50) so I have a stable work history.  As a result of my steady work history, I do not miss a payment which is one of the reasons why I qualify for this loan.  My current budget for debt repayment is $1,300 and this loan will reduce that to about $800 which will free up much needed cash to pay down the remainder of my debt faster and ensure that I provide you the return on your investment as agreed.  I am a good borrower because I have a steady history of paying my bills on time, very stable work history, clearly can afford the payments and I much rather pay you the not-so-great interest of 17% than to pay a greedy, unscrupulous giant credit card company.  You make money, I save money and credit card companies lose money. win-win!""",debt_consolidation,Consolidation,641xx,MO,4.96,0,Dec-1995,3,,,6,0,10984,84.5,9,f,0,0,18462.0400079,18426.58,13000,5462.04,0,0,0,Apr-2015,5992.22,,Jan-2016,0,,1,INDIVIDUAL,,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At the time, all of my credit cards except one went from having interest rates under 10% to having interest rates of over 20%. <br><br>I had the option to not accept the new, higher interest rates, close the credit cards and pay them off at the lower rates, and would have, but I was advised not to do so at the time, as it would have radically changed my credit picture and jeopardized the mortgage I was in the process of getting.<br><br>I will use this loan to pay off all of my credit card debt.<br><br>I am an excellent borrower as I have a spotless payment history with all of my lenders.

Also, being a member of the U.S military, especially an officer, the Army will not allow any of my debts to go into a delinquency status.

I would like to thank all the investors who have already responded to my posted loan request. <br><br>I would like to provide more information in the hopes my full posted loan request is funded.<br><br>For five years, a snowball effect of financial mishaps and hardships has occurred. Some I could have avoided, some I could not. Bottom line, I have been unsuccessful gaining control of my debt because many of these debts are carried with high interest rates.  I have been unsuccessful negotiating lower interest rates with my creditors. I recently developed a spreadsheet listing all my debt. I had a rude awakening when I was able to see of my $721 monthly credit payments, $251 is toward interest (35%). <br><br>The purpose of requesting a $12,000 loan is to finance my high interest debt into a low interest loan. Through this loan, and paying off high interest debt, I project my monthly credit payments to be $675 with $130 towards interest (19%), allowing me the opportunity to comfortably pay off my debt in about three years. <br><br>I have been placing money into a savings account (difficult to access) for unplanned financial mishaps and hardships with the goal of avoiding the use of credit cards (I have cut them up!). <br><br>I have a secure job within a financially sound healthcare organization which I have been employed for ten years. Spring 2012, I enrolled in College with the goal of acquiring a degree in Accounting.  I am currently carrying a 3.88 GPA. I plan to graduate June 2013. Through College business classes I have learned how I CAN improve my financial situation.<br><br>I am loyal with my credit payments. However, I would prefer the opportunity to have most my monthly credit payments applied towards the principal so I can pay my debt off sooner.

This loan is for working capital for a whiskey bar and music venue. We feature drinks and cocktails that hearken back to the Prohibition and Big Band eras, in a return to the elegance of that time. We are the only bar in several towns with a full-size music stage, and we feature at least one band every weekend (mostly blues, bluegrass and rockabilly, although we have had other styles in). We would like to expand into having bands every Friday and Saturday night, as well as an open mic during the week. The owner has experience running a tavern, and he has tons of great ideas for expansion. In addition, he has created jobs for eight other people by starting this business, to say nothing of supporting local bands. The business is up and running, but we are in need of working capital for things like advertising and paying for bands. It is a classy place, and we're already starting to make a name for ourself in our town. We're doing our part to revitalize our downtown area. The owner is already a member of the Chamber of Commerce, and we participate in city chamber events. I have been at my job for over fourteen years, so our ability to repay is secure. We just need some capital to really get things up off the ground.

This is a great platform for lending. I just wanted to reiterate that I have a flawless history of paying all my bills on time and I have never had any delinquent or derogatory accounts. As I mentioned in my earlier post I have just paid off my auto loan. I was paying $644 a month so the monthly payment for this loan is only $63.16 more. I have applied for this loan to consolidate my debt but even with my current debt I can afford this loan. I have requested the loan so that I can clear all my debt obligations at once and focus on paying this loan and saving more money for retirement.
